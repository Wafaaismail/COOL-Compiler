This repository consists of various parts of a COOL compiler. It consists mainly of the following five sections:
	1. Toy programs and games.
	2. Stack Interpreter in COOL.
	3. Lexical analyzer in ANTLR.
	4. Parser.
	5. Semantic analyzer.
The last two segments of the project were a group project. 
There is a README present in every subdirectory of the current one, corresponding to the different segments of the project.
